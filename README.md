# PHP SDK for QuickBooks V3

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/beanworks/quickbooks-online-v3-sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/beanworks/quickbooks-online-v3-sdk)

The PHP SDK for QuickBooks v3 is set of PHP classes that make it easier to call QuickBooks APIs.  Some of the features included in this SDK are as follows:

- Ability to perform single and batch processing of CRUD operations on all supported QuickBooks entities.
- Support for XML Request and Response format.
- Ability to configure app settings in the configuration file requiring no additional code change.
- Support for Gzip and Deflate compression formats to improve performance of QuickBooks API calls.
- Logging mechanisms for trace and request/response.
- Query Filters that enable you to retrieve QuickBooks entities whose properties meet specified criteria.
- Sparse Update to update writable properties specified in a request and leave the others unchanged.
- Change data that enables you to retrieve a list of entities modified during specified time points.
